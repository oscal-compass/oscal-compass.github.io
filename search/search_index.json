Trestle passes the generated artifacts onto tools that orchestrate the enforcement, measurement, and reporting of compliance.</p> <p>Agile Authoring</p> <p>Agile Authoring is a collaborative platform enabling various compliance personas to orchestrate their individual aspects of the compliance artifacts via an interface of their choice. It is a Trestle-based GitOps automated workflow and ensures artifacts consistency and traceability. It provides ready to use CI/CD pipeline configuration and setup using a GitOps approach with Trestle for OSCAL document management and collaboration.</p> <p>Compliance to Policy (aka C2P)</p> <p>Compliance-to-Policy (C2P) bridges Compliance as Code and Policy as Code. C2P takes Compliance requirements and generates technical policies for Policy Validation Points (PVPs), and takes PVP native results and generates Compliance Assessment Results. C2P reduces the cost to implement the interchange between Compliance artifacts and PVP proprietary artifacts. C2P is extensible to various PVPs through plugin.</p>"},{"location":"community/#video-introduction","title":"Video Introduction","text":""},{"location":"community/#community-meetings-and-communications","title":"Community meetings and communications","text":""},{"location":"community/#scheduled-meetings","title":"Scheduled meetings","text":"<p>Please attend!
